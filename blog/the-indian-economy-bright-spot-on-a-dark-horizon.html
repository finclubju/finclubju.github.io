                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Let us take
                                    a look back at the History of the Indian Economy in the late 1900s. Unlike India,
                                    most of the colonized nations got their Economic Freedom before Political Freedom.
                                    India’s whole economy was completely crushed by the British Government. Not only
                                    there was political turmoil in the whole country but also India was going through
                                    its most difficult times in terms of economic growth. The ‘Central Planner Economic
                                    Model’ of Government stagnated economic growth. Not many reforms were made until
                                    1991 when India’s foreign Reserves hit the rock bottom and India was pushed to
                                    secure a loan of $1.4 Bn from the IMF. Witnessing the horrible condition of India’s
                                    economy, the Govt. made some serious reforms that revolutionized the whole economy
                                    of India. In the Budget of 1991, Dr. Manmohan Singh introduced a completely new
                                    Economic Policy to India. The whole edifice of India’s economic reform was built on
                                    the desire to unleash the free spirit of Private Enterprises and Globalization. The
                                    Govt. of India gave full freedom to Private Enterprises and didn’t meddle much with
                                    their internal affairs and expansion. That step gave a phenomenal boost to our
                                    economy and the Budget of 1991 went down in history as The Economic Liberalisation
                                    of India. Now if we go by the GDP growth of India it’s clearly noticeable that after
                                    2010 India’s economy boosted like nothing else reaching new peaks, and breaking
                                    records every year.

                                <h1 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">1. NPS :</h1>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The
                                    implementation of NPS – National Pension Scheme by our former PM Mr. Atal Bihari
                                    Vajpayee. During the early 2000s, a shocking report was released. In that report, it
                                    was mentioned that although civil servants account for only a tiny fraction of the
                                    population still their pension accounts for about 60 percent of India’s GDP. It was
                                    an absolute burden to the economy of the country. This is when the Vajpayee Govt.
                                    came up with a plan known as the National Pension Scheme. Under this scheme the
                                    govt. of India will roll out a pension to civil servants according to the market
                                    condition of India. Unlike the old pension scheme the Govt. invests a portion of the
                                    employee’s salary into Government Bonds, Corporate Bonds, and Equities, and the
                                    employees will receive pensions according to the returns that will be generated by
                                    these financial instruments. In 2009 this scheme was rolled out to every citizen of
                                    India. So huge capital was pumped into this fund which was being used by the Govt.
                                    of India and Private Enterprises to establish themselves and generate huge profits
                                    contributing to the overall growth of India’s Economy. Moreover, under the NPS
                                    system, the Govt. of India is not directly responsible for the pension of the
                                    people. Both the Market as well as the scheme went hand in hand and generated huge
                                    returns to the investors or the pensioners and also benefitted the whole economy of
                                    India.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">FDI in
                                    simple words means Investment made by Foreign Investors. In the FY 2014-15 India’s
                                    FDI inflow shot up nearly 45% (YoY Growth) reaching $45.5 Bn Dollars which again
                                    increased to $60.22 Bn and further to the highest ever FDI inflow of about $83.57 Bn
                                    reported during FY 2021-22. There can be many reasons for the upward trajectory of
                                    FDIs like the credible success of the Indian Diaspora, strong and reliable Govt.
                                    flexibility in setting up units of companies, and so on. In a nutshell, a huge
                                    inflow of FDIs resulted in the economic boom of India.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The Immense
                                    growth of the IT service sector in India pushed the economy to reach new heights.
                                    The IT-BPM (Information technology and Business Process Management) sector of India
                                    has a share of 9.3% of the country’s GDP, making it one of the biggest sectors to
                                    contribute to India’s economic growth. The IT sector captures 56% of the global
                                    outsourcing market. The Software Technology Park of India (STPI) reported that IT
                                    companies associated with it made software exports worth $16.29 billion in only the
                                    first quarter of the financial year 2022. 4.5 lakh employees were hired till
                                    February 2022 in the first quarter of 2022. This has been the highest-ever addition
                                    in any given year. There is significant participation of women as out of the total
                                    new employees, 44% were women. The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in the IT
                                    sector (computer hardware and software, to be precise) between April 2000-December
                                    2021 stood at $81.31 billion (14.19% of the FDI inflows). The data from the
                                    Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) proves that it was
                                    the second-largest sector to have received such high FDI inflows</p>

                                    means 'self-reliant'. The main objective of this scheme is to shape India as an
                                    Export Oriented Country. Increasing export is crucial to fill up the Fiscal Deficit
                                    and the profits generated by exports can ultimately be utilized for strengthening
                                    the infrastructure or the military of India. This scheme endorsed India to make
                                    records in Defence Exports worth Rs. 13000 Crore in FY 2021-22 and now gearing up
                                    for world domination.</p>

                                    population of India contributed to the huge workforce required by different sectors
                                    of India when utilized efficiently. </p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">I enumerated
                                    some of the primary reasons for India’s economic growth. India’s diplomatic stance
                                    on Russia-Ukraine War enabled us to buy Oil at the cheapest price from Russia. The
                                    diversified industries of India are a strong reason for India never going in the
                                    Sri-Lankan way. Apart from these, there are several other reasons for the present
                                    growth of India. India’s economic growth has been not only lauded by the developing
                                    countries but also by Kristalina Georgieva, MD of IMF.</p>
