<div style="height:12px;"></div>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Women in education, financial education. So you know, as we see the budget document of
    India, we would recommend that 6.43 lakh crores are spent on education purpose , but a
    very miniscule amount is you know, diverted towards financial literacy in the country. This
    article is mainly based on how the lack of financial awareness is impacting women.. Lack of
    financial awareness amongst women. Affects us tremendously there's what we call the
    gender pay gap where we earn less for this similar jobs that we do as men. And to top it up it
    also costs more to be a woman. If you're looking at healthcare costs, personal care costs.
    The pink tax is something that's you know getting more popularized, people are talking about
    it. So essentially as women they earn less, they need that money to last them longer and
    they're paying more just to survive as women in this market.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">So money management, investing growing wealth. Protecting wealth, etc. Is all the more
        important for women, lack of financial awareness at basis, We often use this acronym of 4
        d's, So these are: dire life situations which the four D's are Divorce, Debt as in Loan's debt,
        Death of a spouse and Disaster, like these four D's tend to disproportionately impact women
        more so than they do with men, right on a disaster is something we saw play out real time in
        the last couple of years. So all the more reason women need to be more financially, aware
        Studies have shown that nine out of 10 women at some point in our lives, will have to
        manage our money on our own. It's important, it's critical to start as early as possible and
        really take control take charge of their money as women today.</p>
    

  <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">It's incredible to see the focus on investor awareness initiatives, you know, both by regulators
    as well as other bodies in the industry, every AMC has an investor education budget that that
    needs to get utilized. We see, focus from bodies such as Amphi. The NFC is doing a so
    much in terms of driving education. So I think they're moving in the right direction. There's
    still a lot more that can be done. We are obviously living in the age where content distribution
    is has never been easier. In a matter of seconds, you have massive, reach and scale and I
    think it's very early at the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
    In terms of what more can be done with various initiatives, from various players in the
ecosystem. I mean, it's intimidating for anyone Financial jargon documentation.
Understanding products out there in the market, how they work etc, can be scary and
daunting for anyone who's coming into it, as a newbie investor, for instance. What tends to
happen is social conditioning tells us that we don't need to worry about it. And men also tend
to talk more about these things, you know, in a more social context. So women talk less
about money.

  </p>
  
<p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Have this social conditioning from a very young age that, you know, tells us that money is
    not something we need to worry about. In fact, for exp: "If you saw Paytm sort of brand
    campaign last year on Women's Day, where they've done, this social experiment where they
    had men and women asking women, Same questions. Do you file your own income tax
    returns? You take investment decisions for your family, understanding financial documents
    and we just saw how in that social experiment, the gap between men and women was so
    massive... So absolutely, it is scary". There is a lack of confidence, lack of knowledge, lack of trust that impacts women again more so than they do with men. But this problem is
    interested by gender, of course.
    </p>
  
    <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">According to Biswayan Bhandari.. "the patriarchal fabric of the society sort of makes it even
        more difficult for women. If there's men controlling various decisions in their life and money is
        again and enable for almost everything they need. So, definitely patriarchy affects all of this".
        But there is a positive note and that is changing.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Financial advisor, financial planning,amongst families, we've actually heard stories where
        there's inherent bias, and those settings where advisors, again tend to speak to the men.
        Women may have different approaches to managing money and a lot of cases. There are
        lots of studies done on how women make better investors than men, So there are these
        inherent biases that layout in in some of those settings as well. </p>
  
<p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Biswayan Bhandari thinks historically. women have tended to stick to, you know, more
    familiar places to park part money, which are fixed deposits, and and gold right. In fact,
    Indian, women are known to have, you know, have about 11% of the world's gold is with
    Indian women, but, there was an article in today's economic times itself front
    page. Which talks about how just in the last year or two. The number of women investors
    that are coming into, the capital markets have increased. And he thinks that again is a very
    promising sign. As with a lot of, you know, a lot of these trends happening in the industry, we
    are just scratching the surface but trends and some of the more recent stats are are super
    promising, so paychecks are coming back. Home may have been parked in the lower
    risk safer asset classes or asset classes that women were generally more familiar with but
    we are seeing a movement into asset classes like stocks mutual funds and now crypto,
    another hot new asset class!, that is again, getting very popular with with some of the
    younger population as well. Our approach has been, So obviously the gaps we saw in the
    market were knowledge.
    </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Trust confidence gaps, amongst women, Women actually represent the single largest
    underserved market that there is within the financial ecosystem and that's where we saw the
    opportunity, not only from an impact standpoint, but it's also just a massive business
    opportunity, and they adopted this community driven education as step one, So it's not just
    about educating, these urban millennial and genesee women. It's also about having that
    social proof. When a single woman on our community hears how another single woman or a
    recently separated woman handled her money. It gives her the confidence that she can do it.
    We have a number of different very, very exciting stories that
    have come out from our Identity and so just having that social community based adoption of
    financial services education, highly contextual information as well. So information There's no
    lack of it today. Anyone can Google what a stock is But how does it tie in with your goals?.
    Does it make sense for you to invest in it, What are the things? You may need to
    look at based on your financial goals and objectives. And so, we've adopted that approach
    from the beginning vs just diving straight into the transactional layer or, just having
    education on our platform without any context, because there's plenty of that. But for
    whatever reason, this content, this education still hasn't been able to really target
    women in the way that it's supposed to. I'm sure. We'll and every year we see this in March,
    during Women's Day International, Women's History Month, various platforms, will start talking about you know why women aren't investing etc. After that month and separately to a
    lot of companies a lot of platforms.
    </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">See this problem as a marketing problem. Or We'll just market more to women and that
    should you know solve for these issues. But the problems and the gaps run much, much
    deeper than that. And that's what we're focused on at basis with this community driven
    education as step one that obviously needs to lead to action. So that women take action,
    make their first investment ensure they get the right amount of health insurance. They may
    need or life Insurance access to credit. Is another massive market where again the
    penetration amongst women customers increasing but still minuscule,Compared to what it
    may be amongst the other genders. So that's what they're Young woman, a 25 year, old
    working in working in Tech, she talked about how her father had a heart
    attack and all of a sudden, she's an only child, she had to figure out what a will meant and
    how that structured and what, you know what, what we really needed to do as part of with
    and she shared her entire experience. That was eye-opening for us. So that's one example
    where again, the community element again information act the
    right time in a very specific context, really helps. We've had I think the single women
    category is another and it's growing, India currently has its largest number of single women
    ever in our history which means these women are looking for that control and autonomy
    over their money. And we hear a lot from from this segment where, let's say a
    newly separated woman may have had all her money parked in FD'S suddenly has to figure
    out how to grow her wealth, and shares.
    </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Those experiences we have women who saving up for a master's degree. So we see across
    the board how they're very specific financial objectives. Women have a very
    relatable life situations that you know women talk about off late emergency funds, creating
    that has been a hot topic in our community. We've had women share stories, right from. Hey,
    my laptop broke. Thank God. I had my emergency fund to get a new one, all the way to, I
    had a health scare in my family, thank God that, I had an emergency fund. So at least the
    financial stress part of, that was taken away. And so these are, these are kind of the ranges
    of conversations we've seen and what, what I've loved most about the community. And
    learning about how women view money, which, which does tend to differ from, how men
    growing their wealth etc. Is that women have more of this
    supporting their family sort of an approach. So even with the topic like health insurance,
    when we talk about it on basis, yes, we do urge all women to have their individual health
    policies, but there's always questions on How can I get my parents to have better, coverage
    in terms of insurance? How can I get my in-laws to have it? So, there is that inherent like
    How do I support my family, which is like when women are financially independent, people
    say Everyone wins and that that is so true and we've seen it play out on basis diamond
    again.
    </p>
<p class="fs-5 mb-4" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Through being women in finance who knows?. You know that the family itself would sort of
    economically grow, the moment we see more women stepping into it and I think the planning
    mentality also, the whole bit of okay, not the approach that we do it. When we get to it, it's
    always being planned well in advance. Women do tend to have a better long-term
    perspective,Which also kind of feeds into why women make better investors?, So it's not just
    like, who I'm in there to make a quick buck chasing returns. You know, those sort of
    behavioral tendencies, we tend to feel less amongst women tend to be long-term. Thinkers are want to know details, right? That's the other thing we've seen within within our
    community, it's not about just blindly following the heart, Like What does this mean? What
    does this mean for me? Specifically questions like, in a mutual fund What happens if the
    fund manager leaves!.What happens to my money and these But these are questions and
    discussions that we tend not to see in some of you know the other platforms and forums that
    that exists. So it's been eye-opening to be building for women.</p>
